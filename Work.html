Working closely with a team of three people, we focused on maintaining a high level of accuracy and efficiency. While I wasn't deeply involved in reading complex technical diagrams or understanding electronic components, my role required quick scanning and high concentration during office hours to prevent errors. I learned to work efficiently without compromising accuracy, which helped meet production deadlines and maintain quality standards. I also faced challenges like occasional misplacement of components, but thanks to a skilled technician and the team's support, mistakes were quickly corrected, minimizing any disruption to the production line. The work environment emphasized teamwork, precision, and meeting performance targets, which reinforced my ability to stay focused and contribute to the success of the production process. Although the job was physically demanding—leading to some backaches from prolonged periods of standing and poor posture—it was rewarding to see the final product come together.
